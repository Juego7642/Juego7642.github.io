	<div><p>College gonna start soon. Normally I don't get so personal, but I've been thinking. So much of life is spent in anxiety.</p></div>
	<div><p>Which is understandable for a young person - every obstacle you've faced till then is the biggest obstacle in your life yet and it feels like the end of the world, but it really isn't. Most of the past 2 years, 2023-2024, I've spent in a perpetual grind state. Most of it was without the internet. It was the slowest 2 years but I liked it. I liked a lot of it - had many slow days. Many bad days too. I wouldn't say most of those days were the most fun days I've had. But it paid off. Still, I think much of the worrying I did was unnecessary. It just makes it worse - worrying about not being able to finish the syllabus, worrying about my future, worrying about universities. There's also the job of making sure your mental state is okay, that you are getting enoug sleep, that you get excercise sometimes, even trying to understand when and where to take breaks to optimize studying output - it's just a big mess if you think like that. Studying month after month without getting a noticeable improvement in exam results - cause you didn't optimize for those. Your own family saying that you were a waste. Wishing you could run away every day, with a car on a drive going far far away, where no one can find you. Even hanging out with friends have to be measured - can't hang out with people who would distract a wee much from your studies. This shit was life and death to me. Worst was when you went sick or something and had a setback - or had a cycle of bad sleep after messing up your sleep schedule - or school closing down or restarting - forcing you to readjust to a newer schedule. Although finally making progress, I was more at peace in that than anything else. It was my way of running away from the world, Especially because by then I had given up on most of my dreams. Freedom needs to be earned and if you aren't wary enough one day you might lose any chance of living the life you want to live.</p></div>
	<div><p>The concept of wu wei is underrated. Things get taken care of. Just study. It's really that simple. Every hour doesn't need to be measured and taking it easier eventually actually helps with making progress. Being a little easy on yourself that is. You might think I'm lazy but I'm just speaking from experience. You don't wanna be the guy that didn't breathe once in a while, chasing success.</p></div>
