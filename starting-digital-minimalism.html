        <h2>Starting Digital Minimalism</h2>
        <h2>Finally Breaking Free From The Chains</h2></div>
        <div class="maintext"><p>Approximately on 10th of May I switched to my phone after disabling the browser and the playstore - rendering it a dumbphone</p>
        <p>What triggered the change? Having to stay away from the internet for a whole day. I eventually got so bored that I started working out in the shower.</p>
        <p>I was quite amazed, especially because I had become aversive to working out. Although I still disapprove of the cancerous culture of youtube fitness, I realized that my aversion to working out resulted from being stimulated by the internet 24/7.</p>

It was the perfect timing, SubhanAllah. I received the oppurtunity to pursue a digital minimalist lifestyle with almost zero roadblocks. I downloaded readera the first night and started to read books to replace compulsive usage - and stopped using the PC entirely. The wisdom of Thoreau and practical knowledge from the book Digital Minimalism filled my free time as I studied for the SSC exams.</p>

	<p>As of now I started drawing after installing Pixel Station, text messaging online and most recently - reading RSS feeds. Although the last one was not much of a good idea, but more on that later. For now here's some of the pixel art I made:</p></div>
