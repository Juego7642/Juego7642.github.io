        <h2>I Found A Fun Japanese Let's Play Channel Reviewing NIOH</h2>
        <h2>And Also An Update (The First One) On How My Japanese Acquisition is going</h2></div>

        <p>If you don't know I have been learning Japanese on and off for quite a while now, and although I haven't much to show for it (well I did waste a lot of time in the Kanji trap) I am currently doing some freeform language acquisiton, immersion if you will, inspired from Cure Dolly, AJATT and the like. I haven't gotten back to it seriously in a week now, (though I watched some JJBA in between) so I started trying a few search terms in youtube to inspire the algorithm and found an interesting gameplay-commentary video on a game I've been playing lately, NIOH.
        The video was pretty cool not gonna lie.</p>
         
        <iframe width="453" height="255" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CarsZiklHeE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
         
                <p>As for the content of the video, it's an average let's play series but the style of commentary is really interesting to watch and listen to, he speaks and exclaims in a somewhat dramatic, overblown manner sometimes like an arcane japanese general or samurai(maybe that was for fitting the style of game he's playing? It sounds really good though, the raspy voice is a delight to listen to it's so good. He should become a voice actor).<br>But never is his reactions pretentious or annoying, quite the contrary as his commentary seems genuine and excited, like a kid opening a present, fitting of the style of game NIOH is, revealing the settings and stories through the context of the game world, although there is a lot of exposition in the cutscenes. On an unrelated note seeing the player and enemy animations in 60fps seems fascinating, I really need to get my hand on a proper gaming setup soon, the GT 610 from Faiyad isn't cutting it.<br>
                As for the learning value, there is a lot of it. He talks about the story and reflects on it and sometimes even reads the text and dialogue in the game (which is a pleasure as I can't read Kanji if my life depended on it). He talks about the items he receives and even dramatically excalims when fighting the enemies, it feels like watching a shonen anime protagonist sometimes, which is also nice as I am somewhat familiar with that kind of speech.<br>He says stuff like "Ichi Ni no Sayonara da", "koko e nanika aru zo", "futari iru na", "Doko e iku?"(Still I only remember inoru - to pray and senseikougeki - preemptive strike from it lol). And quite often longer sentences which I sometimes get the concept of and sometimes don't, hopefully my scope of understanding through listening will increase as I get familiar with his videos. But it is rewarding when I can understanding seemingly longer sentences including the pleasentaries and speech decoratives. That's what immersion is for, you can review a lot of what you know and get to learn new things, and your intuition improves really well as you get to internalize that knowledge. I still can't read shit though. Hopefully someday...<br>
                The videos are easy to follow along and get involved in thanks to the lucidity of the commentary, even more so if you have experience playing NIOH. Anyways I want to watch his second NIOH video now.<br>The channel name is 兄者弟者 if you are interested.<br>The rss link: https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC2GuoutVyegg6PUK88lLpjw. Don't forget to add it to newsboat.
